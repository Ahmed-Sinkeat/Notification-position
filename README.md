# Notification Position GNOME Shell Extension

This GNOME Shell extension moves notifications from the center to the top left of the screen.

## Installation

### Manual Installation

1. **Download the Extension:**
   - **Using Git**: Clone the repository with this command:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/Ahmed-Sinkeat/Notification-position.git
     ```
   - **Using ZIP**: Download the ZIP file from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Ahmed-Sinkeat/Notification-position) and extract it.

2. **Move the Extension to the GNOME Shell Extensions Directory:**
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you extracted or cloned the extension:
     ```bash
     cd /path/to/Notification-position
     ```
     *(Replace `/path/to/Notification-position` with the actual path)*
   - Move the extension folder to the GNOME Shell extensions directory:
     ```bash
     mv notification@myextension.example.com ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/
     ```
     *(This moves the extension to the correct folder where GNOME Shell looks for extensions)*
